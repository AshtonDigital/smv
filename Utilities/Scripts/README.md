# Utilities/Scripts

This directory contains scripts for generating images and animations of FDS cases.  It also contains utility scripts used by other scripts in this repo, scripts for setting up the graphics environment for the image generating scripts and for identifying Git and compiler versions when building smoke iew. 

## capture_result_slices.py

This script opens a Smokeview case and captures every slice configured for the
result-review shortcuts at 150 s (or the nearest available frame).  Each PNG
uses the fitted axis view at the default zoom and clips blockages at the slice
coordinate from the domain-maximum side.  Size-preserving projection is enabled
to remove perspective, and outline viewing is disabled.  The full render
includes the on-screen result label and clipping position.  By default
Smokeview uses a borderless fullscreen window, renders at the
dimensions of the user's current display, then crops each PNG to the model
with a 20-pixel white border.  All captures for the same X, Y or Z axis use a
common crop size; the colourbar, labels and time bar are removed.  Final names
are human readable, for example
`case Temperature X Slice 001 at 27.700m Clip Max.png`.

```shell
capture_result_slices.py path/to/case.smv
```

Images are written to `path/to/case_slice_captures`.  Use `-o DIR` to choose a
different directory, `--overwrite` to replace existing images,
`--size WIDTHxHEIGHT` to use a windowed capture at an explicit resolution, or
`--smokeview EXE` to select a Smokeview executable.  Use `--time SECONDS` to
override the default capture time, `--crop-padding PIXELS` to change the white
border, or `--no-crop` to retain the full render.  Cropping uses ImageMagick;
the startup dependency check stops before rendering if ImageMagick is missing,
unless `--no-crop` is used.  If an individual model cannot be identified
confidently, that PNG is retained uncropped with a warning.  When no executable
is specified, the script first looks for a compatible Smokeview beside itself,
then checks this repository's build, the `SMV` environment variable, and
`PATH`; older Smokeview releases do not contain the required `RENDERRESULTS`
command.  Run `capture_result_slices.py --help` for all options.

Users without a source checkout can receive a portable folder containing the
matching custom Smokeview build and its resources:

```text
ashton-smokeview-linux-x64/
|-- capture_result_slices.py
|-- smokeview
|-- smokeview.ini
`-- objects.svo
```

The launcher recognises `smokeview`, `smokeview_linux`, or `smokeview.exe`
beside itself.  After installing Python and ImageMagick, a user can extract the
folder and run `./capture_result_slices.py path/to/case.smv` without cloning or
building the repository.  Each bundle must be built for the user's operating
system and architecture, and should also include any required `colorbars/` and
`textures/` directories.

## slice2html.sh

This script is used to generate an HTML page from an smv file. To use it, add an alias to your startup file, typically .bashrc (change the ... in the first part of the path to match your repo location):

```alias slice2html.sh=".../smv/Utilities/Scripts/slice2html.sh"```

Then type `slice2html casename` in a command shell.

## slice2mp4.sh

This script is used to generate an MP4 animation file from a slice file.  It is run on a Linux system with a queing system. To use:

1.  add the alias

```alias slice2mp4=".../smv/Utilities/Scripts/slice2mp4.sh"```

to your startup file, typically .bashrc .  Change the "..." in the first part to match your repo location.

2.  Either use smokeview you built at smv/Build/smokeview/intel_linux or use slice2mp4 with the -i option to use the smokeview installed on  your system.

3.  cd to a directory containing your case and type `slice2mp4 casename` .  You will see a list of slice files for this case such as
```
index   quantity                      dir       position
    1   U-VELOCITY                      3     255.249954
    2   V-VELOCITY                      3     255.249954
    3   VELOCITY                        3     255.249954
    4   W-VELOCITY                      3     255.249954
    5   BURNING RATE(terrain)           3           0.01
    6   LEVEL SET VALUE(terrain)        3            1.0
    7   U-VELOCITY(terrain)             3           25.0
    8   V-VELOCITY(terrain)             3           25.0
    9   VELOCITY(terrain)               3           25.0
   ```

After selecting a slice, index 9 in this example, you will see a menu for selecting various options such as scene viewpoints,  
how images are generated (number of processes, what queue to use) and an option to generate the animation.
`slice2mp4` creates a bash script and a smokeview script used by to generate the mp4 animation.

```
          slice: TEMPERATURE/Y=1.6
         bounds: default
      colour bar: show
       time bar: show
      font size: small
      viewpoint: VIEWYMIN

        PNG dir: .
        mp4 dir: /var/www/html/gforney
      smokeview: /home/gforney/FireModels_fork/smv/Build/smokeview/intel_linux/smokeview_linux
      processes: 32, node sharing on
          queue: batch
          email: gforney@gmail.com

s - select slice
b - set bounds
C - hide colour bar
T - hide time bar
F - toggle font size
v - set viewpoint

r - set PNG dir
a - set mp4 dir
m - set email address

p - set number of processes
S - toggle node sharing
q - set queue

1 - create MP4 animation
x - exit
```

Select the queue, number of processes and an email address to send the animation.  Then to generate an animation, select option 2.

## qsmv.sh

This script is used to run smokeview on a Linux cluster with a PBS or Slurm queuing system in order to generate images for creating an animation. qsmv.sh speeds up the rendering prrocess by running multiple instances of smokeview. Each instance renders a subset of the simulation time frames. By running multiple instances, the total time required to render simulation image frames is reduced.

To get started, add the following alias to your startup file, typically .bashrc 
(change the ... in the first part of the path to match where your repo is located):

```alias qsmv.sh=".../smv/Utilities/Scripts/qsmv.sh"```

To use qsmv.sh type:

```qsmv.sh casename```

(the .smv file extension is not required). This runs smokeview on the case `casename.smv` using the smokeview script `casename.ssf` . To run with a different script say `casename2.ssf` type:
```qsmv.sh -c casename2.ssf casename```

Typically, a smokeview script contains keywords such as RENDER or RENDERALL for generating images.  The keyword RENDER generates one image at one point in time.  The keyword RENDERALL generates images for all time steps in the simulation.  When RENDERALL is used, multiple instances of smokeview may be run by using -p n where n is the number of instances of smokeview where each instance generates a subset of the total images. For example if casename.smv has 1000 time steps, the command

```qsmv.sh -p 5 casename```

will run 5 instances of smokeview with each instance generating 200 images.

qsmv.sh uses either a smokeview that was built in the repo containing qsmv.sh or a smokeview found in your path.  To build smokeview perform the following steps:

1. cd smv/Build/LIBS/intel_linux
2. type: 
 ./make_LIBS.sh
3. cd smv/Build/smokeview/intel_linux 
4. type:
 ./make_smokeview.sh
 
More details on building smokeview may be found [here.](https://github.com/firemodels/smv/tree/master/Build/README.md)  To use the installed smokeview, use the `-i` option.

Details on using qsmv.sh are found below.

```
Usage: qsmv.sh [-e smv_command] [-q queue] casename

runs smokeview on the case casename.smv using the script casename.ssf
