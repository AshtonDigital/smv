# Ashton Smokeview Internal Release Guide

This document defines how the Ashton custom Smokeview fork is built, tested,
versioned, packaged, and distributed internally. The current release line is
based on Smokeview 6.11.2 and uses an Ashton suffix such as `af1`, producing the
combined version `6.11.2-af1`.

## Current Customisation

The fork adds CFD result-review workflows intended to reduce repetitive setup.

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cycle X-minimum, X-maximum, and exterior views |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Cycle Y-minimum, Y-maximum, and exterior views |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Cycle Z-minimum, Z-maximum, and exterior views |
| `Ctrl+I` or `Ctrl+L` | Cycle scalar visibility slices |
| `Ctrl+T` | Cycle scalar temperature slices |
| `Ctrl+V` | Cycle scalar velocity-magnitude slices |
| `Ctrl+P` | Cycle scalar pressure slices |
| `Ctrl+U` | Unload all loaded data and end the active result workflow |

`Ctrl+I` and `Ctrl+L` both select visibility. `Ctrl+I` shares its key code with
TAB, which some window managers and remote-desktop clients (NoMachine/NX among
them) intercept before Smokeview ever receives it; `Ctrl+L` is a collision-free
backup that behaves identically. If both are unresponsive over a remote-desktop
session, tapping `d` and, while still holding it, pressing `i` also triggers
the visibility shortcut — `d` is Smokeview's own sticky-Ctrl key, so this
synthesises the Ctrl modifier with a printable `i` instead of relying on the
raw Ctrl+I key code at all.

Each result shortcut cycles matching planes in X, Y, then Z order. Selecting a
plane loads its slice files, selects the configured colourbar and bounds, clips
at the plane's actual coordinate, selects the matching axis view, and applies a
fitted zoom. The final step turns the workflow off and restores the camera and
clipping state that existed before the workflow started.

The default result mappings are:

| Workflow | Slice label | Colourbar |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visibility | `VIS_C` | `Visibility` |
| Temperature | `temp` | `Temperature` |
| Velocity | `vel` | `Velocity` |
| Pressure | `pres` | `Pressure` |

The visibility default, `VIS_C`, is matched as a family rather than an exact
string: FDS reports the soot visibility quantity as bare `VIS_C` in most cases,
but as `VIS_C` followed by a simulation-specific extinction-coefficient/soot-
yield suffix (for example `VIS_C0.9H0.1`) when the case sets non-default
visibility constants. The default matches either form. Any other
`RESULTWORKFLOW` label (temp/vel/pres, or a custom override) still requires an
exact match, so this only applies to the visibility default.

Mappings can be overridden with `RESULTWORKFLOW` records in the global or
case-specific INI. A case-specific record takes precedence.

### Adding a new shortcut

All fork shortcuts are dispatched from one place: `HandleResultWorkflowShortcut`
in `Source/smokeview/result_workflow.c`, called from `Keyboard()` in
`Source/smokeview/callbacks.c` *before* Smokeview's own upstream keyboard
switch. Returning `1` consumes the keypress; returning `0` falls through to
upstream handling. `Ctrl+<letter>` arrives as the raw ASCII control code
(1-26), which the function folds back to a lowercase letter before the
`switch`, and `Shift` reverses `direction` for the cycling shortcuts.

**Before picking a letter, check both lists it might collide with:**

- This fork's own bindings (the `switch(lower_key)` in
  `HandleResultWorkflowShortcut`): currently `x y z i l t v p m u`.
- Upstream's own `Ctrl+<letter>` bindings in `callbacks.c`'s main keyboard
  switch: currently `b c C D e g h k m s t w`. Search for
  `case '<letter>':` there, since some (like `k`) test
  `keystate == GLUT_ACTIVE_CTRL` inline rather than through a nested
  `case GLUT_ACTIVE_CTRL:` — a plain grep for `GLUT_ACTIVE_CTRL` will miss
  those.

Because the fork's handler runs first and returns `1` unconditionally when a
letter matches, a fork binding **silently shadows** any upstream `Ctrl+<letter>`
action for that same key, with no warning. This already happens for `m`:
the fork's `FlipWorkflowClipSide` (`Ctrl+M`) and upstream's mesh-highlight
cycling (`callbacks.c`, `case 'm':`, `GLUT_ACTIVE_CTRL` branch) claim the same
key, and the fork's binding always wins. Avoid repeating this by mistake for a
new shortcut — reusing a letter deliberately (as here) is fine, but it should
be a conscious choice, not an accident.

Also avoid `d` and `f`: these are Smokeview's own sticky-Ctrl/sticky-Alt keys
(`callbacks.c:1865`/`1921`), so binding them directly would interact oddly
with that mechanism. Remember the Ctrl+I/TAB collision described above when
choosing a letter likely to be intercepted by a window manager or
remote-desktop client — pick a backup binding up front for anything similarly
exposed, rather than waiting for a report from a remote session.

**To add a new cycling result-review workflow** (a fifth quantity alongside
visibility/temperature/velocity/pressure):

1. Add a value to `enum workflow_type` and bump `NRESULT_WORKFLOWS`.
2. Add a matching entry to each of `workflows[]`, `default_slice_labels[]`,
   `default_colorbar_labels[]`, `default_fixed_mins[]`, and
   `default_fixed_maxs[]`.
3. Add `case '<letter>':` to `HandleResultWorkflowShortcut`'s switch, calling
   `SelectWorkflowPlane(WORKFLOW_<NAME>, apply_clip_view, direction)`.
4. If the quantity should ship with fixed company-default bounds, add a
   `C_SLICE`/`V2_SLICE` record to `Build/for_bundle/smokeview.ini` — see the
   `VIS_C` entries for the format.

**To add a standalone shortcut** unrelated to the cycling workflows, add a
`case '<letter>':` directly to `HandleResultWorkflowShortcut`'s switch,
returning `1` when handled. Only do this for a genuinely new fork-specific
action — never to override an existing upstream Smokeview shortcut, since (per
above) that shadowing happens silently.

**After adding any shortcut:**

- Update the shortcut table above and the matching table in
  `Utilities/Scripts/README.md`, and add it to the acceptance-test checklist
  below.
- Rebuild and test manually with a GLUI dialog window focused, not just the
  main graphics window — this is exactly how the Ctrl+I/TAB collision was
  missed originally — and with Caps Lock both on and off, since the vendored
  GLUT folds Caps Lock into the Shift modifier (see the acceptance-test note
  below), which silently reverses cycling direction or disables a shortcut
  that explicitly rejects Shift.

## Repository Management

The internal repository is:

```text
git@github.com:AshtonDigital/smv.git
```

Changes may be committed directly to the internal release branch without a
pull request if that is the team's agreed process. Keep commits focused and do
not commit generated files from `cbuild/` or packaged release archives.

Before starting release work:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git pull --ff-only
```

Use annotated tags for distributed versions. The tag must match the version
reported by `smokeview -version` and printed in the installer filename:

```bash
git tag -a ashton-smv-v6.11.2-af1 -m "Ashton Smokeview 6.11.2-af1"
git push origin ashton-smv-v6.11.2-af1
```

Only tag a commit after its release package has passed the acceptance tests.

### Pre-release test builds

While a release line is still being iterated on and has not yet been tagged,
set `ASHTON_RELEASE` to that release name with an `-rcN` suffix, for example
`af1-rc1`, `af1-rc2`, and so on for each distributed test build. This keeps
successive test builds distinguishable (in the `-version` banner, the
installer filename, and the embedded checksum) without implying a numbered
release (`af2`) has begun. `ASHTON_RELEASE` is a free-form string, so no other
build or packaging script needs to change to support this.

Once a build passes acceptance testing, drop the `-rcN` suffix (`af1-rc3`
becomes `af1`), rebuild and repackage so the final artefact's embedded version
matches exactly, and only then create the annotated tag. Do not tag an `-rcN`
build. The next release line after a tagged version increments the numbered
suffix as before (`af1` to `af2`, not `af1.1`).

## Configuration Files

Smokeview reads its global configuration from `smokeview.ini` in the detected
Smokeview root directory. For the portable internal package, the executable,
`smokeview.ini`, and `objects.svo` must be placed in the same top-level
directory.

The approved company-default configuration is maintained at:

```text
/home/tomcox/SharedFolder/VMLinux/smokeview.ini
```

`Build/for_bundle/smokeview.ini` is the version-controlled release snapshot of
that file and is packaged on both platforms. The company default is a complete
saved Smokeview configuration, not just a colourbar definition file. Review
changes to it for:

- the standard Smokeview defaults required by the team;
- the five approved company `GCOLORBAR` definitions;
- the approved `V2_SLICE` bounds;
- any required `RESULTWORKFLOW` overrides.

Only ship case-specific camera, input-file, clipping, or display state when the
team has explicitly approved those settings as part of the company default.

## Development Build

Use the persistent ignored build directory for local testing:

```bash
cmake -S . -B cbuild/review \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DVENDORED_UI_LIBS=ON \
  -DVENDORED_LIBS=OFF

cmake --build cbuild/review --target smokeview -j4
```

For current development testing, place the required resources beside the
executable:

```bash
cp /home/tomcox/SharedFolder/VMLinux/smokeview.ini cbuild/review/smokeview.ini
cp Build/for_bundle/objects.svo cbuild/review/objects.svo
```

Run a representative case with:

```bash
./cbuild/review/smokeview /absolute/path/to/case.smv
```

Do not test by running Smokeview without a case file.

## Release Build

Create a clean release build with the vendored GLUT library linked statically.
This prevents the package from referring to a library inside the developer's
checkout.

For normal releases, use the platform packaging scripts from the repository
root. To match the official Smokeview distribution format, Linux produces a
self-extracting `.sh` installer and Windows produces an NSIS `.exe` installer.

```bash
./scripts/package_release_linux.sh
```

From an x64 Visual Studio Developer PowerShell on Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\package_release_windows.ps1
```

Both scripts use `Build/for_bundle/smokeview.ini`, the committed snapshot of
the company default. Use `--config` or `-ConfigFile` only to test an explicitly
selected alternative configuration.

Both scripts put the installer and a SHA-256 checksum in `dist/`. They accept
`--help`/`Get-Help`-style parameter discovery and can package an existing build
with `--skip-build`/`-SkipBuild`. The Windows package uses the static MSVC
runtime so that installing the Visual C++ Redistributable is not a prerequisite.
Creating the Windows installer also requires NSIS 3 and its `makensis.exe`
compiler.

The release version combines the upstream Smokeview version with the Ashton
fork release, for example `6.11.2-af1`. Increment `ASHTON_RELEASE` in the root
`CMakeLists.txt` (`af2`, `af3`, and so on) before creating the next release.
The packaging scripts derive the version automatically and reject an installer
whose package version does not match the revision embedded in its executable.

Both installers include `capture_result_slices.py` beside the Smokeview
executable. This keeps the capture utility matched to the custom build and lets
it discover the installed executable without a `--smokeview` argument. End
users still need Python 3.10 or newer (enforced with a clear error rather than
a raw `SyntaxError`/exception on older interpreters) and, unless they use
`--no-crop`, ImageMagick (either the `magick` or the `convert` command). On
Ubuntu/Debian, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

On Windows, the installer adds **Capture result slices** to the `.smv` file
context menu. On Linux, it installs the `af-smv` and `smv-cap` commands and
registers **Capture result slices** as an `.smv` application under **Open
With**. These actions start a separate automated Smokeview process; an
existing interactive window can remain open.

### Building on the correct Linux version

glibc is backward-compatible but not forward-compatible: a binary built on a
newer Linux distribution requires that distribution's glibc or newer, and fails
on an older one with an error like:

```text
smokeview: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.38' not found
```

**Always build the release binary on the oldest Linux version you need to
support, never on a newer development machine.** For example, a workstation
running Ubuntu 26.04 (glibc 2.43) cannot produce a binary that runs on a
machine running Ubuntu 22.04 "jammy" (glibc 2.35) — building on jammy itself
(or older) produces a binary that runs on jammy *and* on every newer release.

If the development machine itself runs a newer Ubuntu release than your oldest
supported target, build inside a container matching the target instead of on
the host:

```bash
sudo docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/src -w /src ubuntu:22.04 bash
```

(`sudo` is required for a snap-installed Docker, which does not create a
regular `docker` group.) Inside the container:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git \
  freeglut3-dev libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglew-dev libgd-dev libjson-c-dev
```

Ubuntu 22.04's apt `cmake` is 3.22, but this project requires 3.24 or newer
(`CMakeLists.txt:2`). Get a current one with pip instead of apt:

```bash
apt-get install -y python3-pip
pip3 install --upgrade cmake
hash -r
cmake --version
```

Then build and package as normal (see the Release Build steps below); because
`/src` is a bind mount of the repository, `dist/` appears on the host as soon
as packaging finishes, with no extra copy step. Verify the glibc floor before
distributing:

```bash
objdump -T cbuild/release-linux/smokeview | grep GLIBC_ | sed 's/.*GLIBC_//' | sort -uV | tail -1
```

That version must not exceed the oldest supported target's glibc version
(2.35 for Ubuntu 22.04).

The manual commands below document the underlying Linux process and remain
useful for troubleshooting.

```bash
rm -rf cbuild/release-linux

cmake -S . -B cbuild/release-linux \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
  -DVENDORED_UI_LIBS=ON \
  -DVENDORED_LIBS=OFF

cmake --build cbuild/release-linux --target smokeview -j4
```

Inspect the resulting binary before packaging:

```bash
ldd cbuild/release-linux/smokeview
readelf -d cbuild/release-linux/smokeview | grep -E 'RPATH|RUNPATH' || true
```

The output must not contain paths under a developer's home directory or source
checkout. The Linux build will still depend on common system OpenGL, X11, image,
and C/C++ runtime libraries — see "Building on the correct Linux version" above
for why the build host matters, not just the runtime libraries. Test the
package on every supported Linux image.

## Package Layout

The Linux and Windows installers contain equivalent application resources.
The Linux payload has this layout:

```text
ashton-smokeview-v6.11.2-af1-linux-x64/
|-- smokeview
|-- capture_result_slices.py
|-- smokeview.ini
|-- objects.svo
|-- colorbars/
|-- textures/
|-- README.txt
`-- VERSION
```

The Windows payload uses `smokeview.exe` and also includes
`capture_result_slices.cmd`, which provides dependency checking and invokes the
Python capture utility. `VERSION` contains the release version, Git commit,
build date, platform and compiler. `README.txt` contains the launch and capture
commands, dependency notes, configuration location and support information.

The packaging scripts assemble these payloads automatically. The equivalent
manual Linux staging commands are useful only for troubleshooting:

```bash
version=6.11.2-af1
package="dist/ashton-smokeview-v${version}-linux-x64"

rm -rf "$package"
mkdir -p "$package"
install -m 0755 cbuild/release-linux/smokeview "$package/smokeview"
install -m 0755 Utilities/Scripts/capture_result_slices.py \
  "$package/capture_result_slices.py"
install -m 0644 Build/for_bundle/smokeview.ini "$package/smokeview.ini"
install -m 0644 Build/for_bundle/objects.svo "$package/objects.svo"
cp -R Build/for_bundle/colorbars "$package/colorbars"
cp -R Build/for_bundle/textures "$package/textures"
```

For troubleshooting, create the payload archive directly with:

```bash
tar -C dist -czf "${package}.tar.gz" "$(basename "$package")"
```

The release script performs this staging automatically, embeds the compressed
payload after its installer shell code, and checksums the resulting `.sh` file.

## Acceptance Testing

Use one representative case that contains all required scalar quantities and
X, Y, and Z slice planes. Record the case name and test result with the release.

Verify all of the following before distributing a release:

- Smokeview starts from the installed package without access to the source tree.
- Startup output reports the package directory as `Root directory`.
- Startup output reports the packaged `smokeview.ini` and `objects.svo`.
- Existing important shortcuts still work: `O`, `Alt+V`, `Alt+B`, `Alt+C`,
  `Space`, `1` through `9`, and existing mouse modifiers.
- `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+Y`, and `Ctrl+Z` cycle the expected standard views.
- `Ctrl+I`, `Ctrl+T`, `Ctrl+V`, and `Ctrl+P` select the correct scalar quantity.
  Test `Ctrl+I` specifically **with a GLUI dialog window focused**, not just
  the main graphics window — Ctrl+I shares its key code with TAB, which GLUI
  previously intercepted for dialog focus-cycling regardless of the Ctrl
  modifier. `Ctrl+L` selects visibility identically, as a backup binding that
  does not share a key code with any other key.
- With Caps Lock on, `Ctrl+X`, `Ctrl+Y`, `Ctrl+Z`, and `Ctrl+U` do nothing (the
  vendored GLUT folds Caps Lock into the Shift modifier), and `Ctrl+I`/`Ctrl+L`/
  `Ctrl+T`/`Ctrl+V`/`Ctrl+P` cycle backwards instead of forwards. This is
  expected; confirm it does not surprise testers rather than treating it as a
  regression.
- Each result workflow cycles every expected X, Y, and Z plane in order.
- Each selected slice receives the correct colourbar and numeric bounds.
- Clipping uses the selected slice's actual coordinate.
- X and Y slices use the expected side view; Z slices use the top-down view.
- The fitted zoom shows the complete domain and normal zoom controls remain usable.
- Advancing to `off` restores the previous camera and clipping state.
- `Ctrl+U` unloads all data and restores the pre-workflow camera and clipping.
- The installer passes testing on a second machine that has no source checkout.
- The published `.sha256` file validates the installer.
- The installed capture utility reports Python, Smokeview and ImageMagick
  dependencies clearly before rendering.
- The capture utility renders, crops and renames all configured result slices.
- Capture can run in a separate automated process while an interactive
  Smokeview window remains open.
- On Windows, double-clicking an `.smv` file opens Ashton Smokeview and the
  **Capture result slices** File Explorer context action works.
- On Linux, `af-smv` and `smv-cap` are available, an `.smv` file opens in
  Ashton Smokeview by default, and **Open With > Capture result slices** works
  in the desktop file manager.
- On a shared Linux machine installed with `--system`, `af-smv` and `smv-cap`
  resolve and run for a **second, non-installing user account**, not just the
  account that ran the installer, and that second user also gets the `.smv`
  **Open With > Capture result slices** entry.

## Publishing Internally

Publish both the installer and its `.sha256` file using one controlled location:

- a release attached to the internal Ashton GitHub repository; or
- a versioned folder in the company SharedFolder; or
- the company's managed internal software repository.

Do not distribute an unversioned installer over an existing release. Keep old
installers available so a team can roll back to the preceding known-good version.

Linux recipients installing only for themselves should make the downloaded
installer executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x ashton-smokeview-v6.11.2-af1-linux-x64.sh
./ashton-smokeview-v6.11.2-af1-linux-x64.sh
```

That installs under `$HOME/.local/opt`, with the `af-smv`/`smv-cap` commands
symlinked into `$HOME/.local/bin` and the `.smv` file association set only for
that user.

### Installing for every user on a shared machine

On a shared machine where several people need to run Smokeview and cannot use
sudo themselves, one administrator installs it once for everybody with
`--system`:

```bash
chmod +x ashton-smokeview-v6.11.2-af1-linux-x64.sh
sudo ./ashton-smokeview-v6.11.2-af1-linux-x64.sh --system
```

`--system` requires root and installs into `/opt`, symlinks `af-smv`, `smv-cap`
and a generic `smokeview` into `/usr/local/bin` (on every user's `PATH` by
default), and registers the `.smv` file association and desktop entries under
`/usr/share` rather than any one user's home directory. It also sets the
system-wide default `.smv` application directly, since `xdg-mime default` only
ever writes the invoking (root) user's own configuration and cannot set a
machine-wide default on its own. **Do not** run the installer as root without
`--system` — that installs a copy usable only by the root account, under
`/root`, which is invisible and useless to everyone else; the installer prints
a warning if you do this.

Because the target machine itself needs no build tools, only these runtime
packages, install them once on the shared machine (adjust package names for
non-Debian distributions):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libglew2.2 libgd3 libgl1 libglu1-mesa libxmu6 libx11-6 \
  libxext6 libxt6 imagemagick python3
```

One consequence of a root-owned, shared `/opt` install: users cannot save
Smokeview settings back into the packaged `smokeview.ini`, since it is not
writable by them. This has not come up as a problem in practice, since the
approved company default is meant to be used as shipped, but it is worth
knowing if a user reports that "Save Settings" silently fails.

Windows recipients run the `.exe` installer normally. The Linux installer cannot
be used natively on Windows; each platform needs its own build and acceptance-test
pass.

## Remaining Release Work

The following items still require a team decision or release-specific action:

- approve any additional shortcut behaviour;
- select and retain a representative regression-test case;
- decide the supported Linux distributions and minimum library versions;
- decide whether a separate velocity-vector workflow is required;
- write release notes for each distributed Ashton version;
- perform clean-machine acceptance testing on both platforms;
- select the final commit, build both installers, test them, then create the
  matching annotated tag.

Update this document whenever the shortcut contract, configuration format,
supported platforms, packaging layout, or release process changes.
